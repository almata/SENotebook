## About me

I am Albert, a Catalan software developer currently living in Barcelona. I started a business career after earning a Bachelor's Degree in Business Studies (2002). But soon after I became interested in software development, specifically in business-related applications, and started working as a programmer and went back to college. In 2008 I earned a Master's Degree in SAP Functional Consulting and some time later, in 2012, a second Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. It's been a long journey full of interesting experiences... and it keeps going, as at this moment I am in the process of getting a second Master's Degree in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics (probably in 2019).

I love running, teaching, watching TV series, listening to podcasts, Apple devices and, of course, developing software. I have solid skills on database design, object-oriented programming, project management and UI and UX design.

## How to create a notebook like this

For the last fifteen years or so I have used several blogging solutions: Blogger, WordPress, Octopress, Jekyll, Blogdown and even custom sites manually crafted using ASP (back in 2003), PHP (some years later), plain static HTML files (at different times)... None of those were what I really wanted to use, as I have always been looking for a system with these characteristics:

* __It has to be extremely easy to use__. When I am to add some content I do not want to run any command or use any template and follow some rigid rules. This way, if I stay away from my notebook for some time, I still will remember how to add some content when I get back. 
* __It has to be magic-free__. If I have to install gems, dependency managers, clone some repository, go find where to add my content, run more commands... I will simply get bored and stop keeping my notebook up to date.
* __It has to use a really basic technology stack__, so that I do not feel I am even running any software but just creating files the same way I would do otherwise. Markdown and (basic) Git seem like a reasonable choice.

So I decided to create this system myself. I call it [BlogGit](https://github.com/almata/BlogGit), as it kind of resembles a blogging system and is totally based on Git. [Feel free to use it to create your own notebook](https://github.com/almata/BlogGit).
