# Quote from _Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There_

> "Well, in our country," said Alice, still panting a little, "you'd generally get to somewhere else -if you run very fast for a long time, as we've been doing."
>
> "A slow sort of country!" said the Queen. "Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!"

_Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There_, Lewis Carroll (Macmillan, 1871)

I felt a bit like Alice the moment Apple announced Swift on WWDC 2014. Two hours later, I was already reading The Swift Programming Language book and playing with Xcode 6. If it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place, there's not much else we can do, right? :)
