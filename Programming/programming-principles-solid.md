# Programming principles (SOLID)

## SOLID Principles 

### Single Responsibility Principle

* Do one thing and do it well.
* Short and focused methods, small and focused classes.

### Open Closed Principle

* Be open for extension and closed for modification.

### Liskov Substitution Principle

* Derived classes can stand in for base classes.
* Replacing an object with an instance of a subtype shouldn't alter the correctness of a program.

### Interface Segregation Principle

* Make interfaces fine grained and client specific.
* Expose only those things that you absolutely have to.
* Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

### Dependency Inversion

* Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.

## Other Principles

### Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

* Clipboard inheritance is an anti-pattern. 

### The Boy Scout Principle

* Clean up after yourself, clean up after others.
* For instance, add some unit tests if there are none.

### You Ain't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)

* Focus on current actual requirements.

### Separation Of Concerns

* Focusing one's attention upon some aspect.
* For instance, don't mix your UI and your database logic all together.
* (Similar to Single Responsibility Principle).
