# Create an alias

We create aliases with the `alias` command and store them in the `~/.profile` file. For instance, this is one I like to have on my machines:

```bash
$ cat ~/.profile
alias l="ls -lha"
```

This way, first thing I usually do after `cd`'ing into any directory is just type `l` to check its content.
