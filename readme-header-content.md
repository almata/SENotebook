# Software Engineering Notebook (Albert Mata)

When you have been working with different technologies and programming languages for some years, it is easy to end up with lots of files, notes, snippets, gists, repos, bookmarks... many little pieces of useful information here and there. This Software Engineering Notebook is my attempt to keep all of them organized using an extremely simple system based on Markdown and Git.
